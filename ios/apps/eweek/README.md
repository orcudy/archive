##eWeek 2015
#####A real-time leaderboard and schedule of events by Chris Orcutt

eWeek 2015 was built as a companion application for the Engineering Society of UCLA's annual week long event called Engineering Week.

All pieces of the project (including design and creation of icons and buttons) were built entirely by Chris Orcutt.

The application was [released](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=981637936&mt=8) to the Apple App Store in the Spring of 2015.
