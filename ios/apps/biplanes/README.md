#Biplanes!
####An iOS game about planes by Chris Orcutt

**Biplanes!** was built in 8 weeks during the MakeSchool (formerly MakeGamesWithUs) Summer Academy.

Everything (except the planes, obstacles, and buttons) was designed and built independently using SpriteBuilder.

SpriteBuilder updates have since broken the application (as such, this repository should be used for reference only); however, a working build was [released](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/biplanes!/id904104087?ls=1&mt=8!) to the Apple App Store in Summer of 2014.
